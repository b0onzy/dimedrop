Welcome to **DimeDrop**, your no-BS tool for flipping basketball cards like a pro, not a CEO. Built as a personal project for card junkies, it tracks eBay prices, sniffs out Reddit hype, and keeps your collection's ROI in check. Right now, it's running on a Gradio prototype frontend (simple, effective, a bit scrappy), with a Next.js glow-up planned for the future. Catch that Wembanyama Prizm at ~$150 with a Flip Score of 85/100 and flex your +12% portfolio gains.

## üéØ What's DimeDrop?

DimeDrop is an open-source sidekick for basketball card flippers. It's not a fancy SaaS‚Äîit's a tool for anyone who wants to outsmart the market with data. The Gradio frontend is bare-bones but gets the job done, while the backend's ready to scale when we hit the Next.js court.

### üí∞ Current Features (October 2025)

- **Price Tracking**: Live eBay prices (e.g., Wembanyama Prizm at $150 avg, cached 90 days per ToS).
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Reddit's r/basketballcards vibe check (Flip Score 85/100 for Wemby, 70% positive buzz).
- **Portfolio Management**: Track your cards, see ROI (like 27% on that Wemby buy), and export to CSV for taxes.
- **Smart Alerts**: Get pinged when prices spike (e.g., Wemby > $150).
- **Gradio Frontend**: Simple Python UI to browse prices, check sentiment, and manage your stash.
- **Experimental Goodies**: AI vision scanning (YOLOv8) and price forecasting (LSTM, ~$0.53 accurate but still tweaking).

**Coming Soon**: A sleek Next.js frontend with dark mode, Tailwind CSS, and a proper dashboard.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Gradio (Python-based, prototype vibes).
- **Backend**: FastAPI (async, <2s responses), Python 3.12+, Poetry.
- **APIs**: eBay SDK (real data, per recent commit), Reddit PRAW (sentiment).
- **Database**: SQLite (local, lightweight). Supabase integration in the works.
- **AI/ML**: YOLOv8 for card scanning, LSTM for forecasting (buggy but promising).
- **Testing**: pytest, targeting 97% coverage (per `DEVELOPMENT.md`).

   ```

   Edit `.env` with your keys (just eBay and Reddit for now):

   ```bash
   # eBay API (get from developer.ebay.com)
   EBAY_APP_ID=your_ebay_app_id
   EBAY_CERT_ID=your_ebay_cert_id
   EBAY_DEV_ID=your_ebay_dev_id

   # Reddit API (get from reddit.com/prefs/apps)

   ```

4. **Run the app**:

   ```bash
   # Backend (FastAPI, new terminal)
   poetry run uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

   # Frontend (Gradio, new terminal)
   poetry run python frontend/gradio_app.py
   ```

5. **Access the app**:
   - Gradio UI: `http://localhost:7860` (check terminal for port).
   - Backend API: `http://localhost:8000/docs` (Swagger UI for geeks).
   - Mobile: Use `http://your-local-ip:7860` (e.g., `192.168.1.10:7860`).

## üìä How to Use It
