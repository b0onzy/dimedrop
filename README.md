Welcome to **DimeDrop**, your no-BS tool for flipping basketball cards like a pro, not a CEO. Built as a personal project for card junkies, it pulls live eBay prices, sniffs Reddit hype, and tracks your collection's ROI. Right now, it's rocking a Gradio prototype frontend‚Äîsimple, scrappy, and functional‚Äîwith a Next.js upgrade on the horizon. Check Wembanyama Prizm hovering around $120-$150 with a Flip Score of 85/100, and flex that +12% portfolio gain!

## üéØ What's DimeDrop?

DimeDrop is an open-source sidekick for basketball card flippers. It's not a slick SaaS‚Äîit's a tool for anyone who wants to outsmart the market with real data. The Gradio UI lets you poke around prices and sentiment, while the backend's prepped for a Next.js leap when we're ready.

### üí∞ Current Features (October 2025)

- **Price Tracking**: Grabs live eBay prices for cards you search or add. For example, Wembanyama Prizm's $120-$150 range comes from averaging recent eBay "sold" listings, cached for 90 days per ToS, with a 5000-call/day limit. You pick the card by typing its name in the Gradio search bar‚ÄîDimeDrop doesn't auto-choose; it's all manual for now.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Scans r/basketballcards posts for a Flip Score (e.g., 85/100 for Wemby, based on 70% positive buzz). You enter the card name, and it tallies recent sentiment‚Äîpositive, negative, neutral‚Äîusing Reddit PRAW, updated daily if you rerun the app.
- **Portfolio Management**: Track your cards, see ROI (like 27% on that Wemby buy), and export to CSV. Add cards via Gradio's input fields with buy price and quantity‚Äîyour portfolio, your rules.
- **Smart Alerts**: Get pinged when a card's price spikes (e.g., Wemby > $150). Set a target price in Gradio, and it checks eBay data on refresh.
- **Gradio Frontend**: A Python-based UI to search, analyze, and manage your stash‚Äîbasic but gets the job done.
- **Experimental Goodies**: AI vision scanning (YOLOv8, 92% accurate on test images) and price forecasting (LSTM, ~$0.53 off but still glitchy). Upload a card photo or request a forecast in Gradio, but expect some bugs.

**Coming Soon**: A Next.js frontend with dark mode, Tailwind CSS, and a slick dashboard.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Gradio (Python-based, prototype vibes).
- **Backend**: FastAPI (async, <2s responses), Python 3.12+, Poetry.
- **APIs**: eBay SDK (real "sold" listings), Reddit PRAW (sentiment).
- **Database**: SQLite (local, stores your portfolio and cached prices).
- **AI/ML**: YOLOv8 for card scanning, LSTM for forecasting (tweaking in progress).
- **Testing**: pytest, aiming for 97% coverage.

   # Frontend (Gradio, new terminal)
   poetry run python frontend/gradio_app.py
   ```

5. **Access the app**:
   - Gradio UI: `http://localhost:7860` (check terminal for port).
   - Backend API: `http://localhost:8000/docs` (Swagger UI).
   - Mobile: Use `http://your-local-ip:7860` (e.g., `192.168.1.10:7860`).
